  <h4>What Makes a
Player ELITE?</h4>
  <p>Lately there has been much discussion amongst owners in
the BMFFL about what makes a player ELITE. The
conversation has centered around a certain few athletes.
(And before I say who they are I just want to say that if
you're going to go after an amateur athlete, if you're going
to go after one of my athletes, especially one who does
everything right, except poke opponents in the eyes, then
you better come after me, because I'm a man, I'm 40, I'm
not a kid, that's why I don't read the Bowery Times, because
it's garbage, and the senior editor doesn't have his facts
straight). Anyway, this prestigious club of (potential)
ELITE athletes includes the likes of Joe Flacco, the great
Sioux City product Adam Woodbury, and yesterday the
question was posed as to whether Jay Cutler is ELITE.
Seriously? Who axed that? Is that person high?
There are three criteria that are used to determine if an
athlete is ELITE:
1) Individual Performance. An elite athlete must have
statistics that are well above the league standard.
2) Championships. You've gotta win championships. You
can talk about how great Archie Manning was all day long,
but they guy didn't win squat. And he played at Ole Miss.
Which isn't as bad as Mississippi State though. If you're not
familiar with Mississippi State, they're kind of about as
good at Matt's fantasy team on a year to year basis.
3) The eye test. You know an ELITE athlete when you see
one. This is the criteria that fuels most debates as to
whether or not an athlete is ELITE.
Now, let's look at a couple of examples of ELITE players.
I'll include players from a few different sports. These
players can be from the past or the present. </p>
